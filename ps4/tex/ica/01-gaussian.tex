\item \subquestionpoints{8} \textbf{Gaussian source}

For this sub-question, we assume sources are distributed according to a standard normal distribution, i.e $s_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1), j=\{1,\ldots,\di\}.$ The log-likelihood of our unmixing matrix, as described in the notes, is

$$\ell(W) = \sum_{i=1}^\nexp\left(\log|W| + \sum_{j=1}^\di \log g'(w_j^Tx^{(i)})\right),$$ where $g$ is the cumulative distribution function, and $g'$ is the probability density function of the source distribution (in this sub-question it is a standard normal distribution). Whereas in the notes we derive an update rule to train $W$ iteratively, for the cause of Gaussian distributed sources, we can analytically reason about the resulting $W$.

Let $g$ be the CDF of the standard normal distribution. Derive the relationship between $W$ and $X$ in the simplest form, aiming at a closed-form expression for $W$ in terms of $X$. If you cannot find one, explain why such a closed form expression does not exist. (Hint: Think in terms of rotational invariance.)
