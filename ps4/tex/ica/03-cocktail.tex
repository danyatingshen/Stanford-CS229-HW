\item \subquestionpoints{8} \textbf{Cocktail Party Problem}

For this question you will implement the Bell and Sejnowski ICA algorithm, but
\textbf{assuming a Laplace source} (as derived in part-b), instead of the Logistic distribution
covered in class. The file \texttt{src/ica/mix.dat} contains the input data which consists of a matrix
with 5 columns, with each column corresponding to one of the mixed signals
$x_i$. The code for this question can be found in \texttt{src/ica/ica.py}.

First implement the \texttt{update\_W} and \texttt{unmix} functions in \texttt{src/ica/ica.py}. Then, you can run \texttt{ica.py} to split the mixed audio into its components. The mixed audio tracks are written to \texttt{mixed\_i.wav} in the output folder. The split audio tracks are written to \texttt{split\_i.wav} in the output folder. To make sure your code is correct, you should listen to the resulting unmixed sources. \\
\textbf{Finally, include the full unmixing matrix $W$ (5$\times$5) that you obtained in W.txt in your write-up.}\\
Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  Some overlap or noise in the sources may be present, but the different sources should be pretty clearly separated. If you implemention is correct, your output \texttt{split\_0.wav} should sound similar to the file \texttt{correct\_split\_0.wav} included with the source code.
  \item If your media player reports decoding error, try using the VLC media player.
  \item Mac users: iTunes may play the original mixed versions even if the program runs correctly. If your program doesnâ€™t seem to be doing anything, consider renaming the saved sounds to slightly different filenames to double-check.
\end{enumerate}
