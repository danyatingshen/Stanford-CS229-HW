\item \subquestionpoints{8} \textbf{Laplace source.}

For this sub-question, we assume sources are distributed according to a standard Laplace distribution, i.e $s_i \sim \mathcal{L}(0,1)$. The Laplace distribution $\mathcal{L}(0,1)$ has PDF $f_{\mathcal{L}}(s) = \frac{1}{2}\exp\left(-|s| \right)$. With this assumption, derive the update rule for a single example to solve ICA using gradient ascent\footnote{In our implementation, we {\bf anneal} the learning rate $\alpha$ (slowly decreased it over time) to speed up learning. In addition to using the variable learning rate to speed up convergence, one thing that we also do is choose a random permutation of the training data, and running stochastic
gradient ascent visiting the training data in that order. Each of the specified learning rates was then used for one full pass through the data.}, in the form
$$ W := W + \alpha \left(\ldots\right)$$
