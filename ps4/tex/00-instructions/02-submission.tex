{\bf Submission:} 
(1) All students must submit an electronic PDF version of the written questions. You will receive one bonus point (as in, a point on the same scale as in this problem set) for typesetting the homework using \LaTeX. Bonuses will be applied only after course grade cutoffs have been determined.
This is a very minor incentive, but we also think you will find it more convenient overall to typeset. You may submit a non-typeset or even handwritten version, but if you do, please write neatly -- illegible responses may receive no credit!

%We
%highly recommend typesetting your solutions via \LaTeX, and we will award one bonus point for submissions typeset in \LaTeX. 
(2) Please make sure to tag your solutions properly on Gradescope.
The graders reserve the right to penalize incorrectly tagged solutions by 0.5 points per question.

(3) All students must also submit a zip file of
their source code to Gradescope, which should be created using the
\texttt{make\_zip.py} script. You
should make sure to (1) restrict yourself to only using libraries included in
the
\texttt{environment.yml} file, and (2) make sure your code runs without errors.
Your submission may be evaluated by an auto-grader using a private test set, or used for verifying the outputs reported in the writeup.
